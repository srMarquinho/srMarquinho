Former educator and manager with many years of experience, I began my career at a software development company, where I created and maintained various types of software â€“ both user and admin-facing. These ranged from warehouse delivery solutions to a government job-seeker website.

Since then, I have been delivering solutions for high-profile companies and customers, always utilizing the latest cutting-edge technologies and methodologies. 

Currently, I have been revolutionizing the clinician-patient experience at the point of care. I have helped develop an Electronic Document Management System tailored for the NHS. Transforming physical, unstructured and legacy records from multiple systems, into digital, organised, searchable and shareable content.

Previously, for over five years, I powered the integration of media and data sources, building new content experiences for users through uniquely powerful workflows. This involved integrating multiple live data sources, including live HD high-frame rate video and high-frequency telemetry. These were integrated with consistent and accessible data query APIs.

I'm passionate about learning new technologies as they evolve.
