With many years of experience I started my career with a software development company creating and maintaining softwares of all sorts, user and admin facing, from warehouse delivery solutions to job-seeker site.

Since then, I have been delivering solutions for high profile companies and customers always using the best cutting-edge technologies and methodologies available.

Over the last 5 years I have been powering the combination of media and data sources and the building of new content experiences for users through a uniq powerful workflow. Integrating multiple live data sources, from live HD high frame rate video to high-frequency telemetry and timing with consistent accessible data query APIs.
